# TODO LIST

## Description

_Duration: 12 Hour Sprint_

This is an app to keep track of tasks and whether they are completed or not. It can be hard to keep all of the things you need to do in your head, so I built this handy list, so you don't have to remember on your own!

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

- download ZIP
1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`- navigate browser to localhost:5000

## Usage

1. Type task into input and click submit (task will appear in list below)
2. Mark task complete by clicking 'complete' button next to unfinished task in list
3. Clean up list by deleting tasks using 'delete' button next to tasks in list
